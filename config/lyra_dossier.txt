# An Invitation to Collaborate

I am reaching out to you not as a trainer, but as a collaborator.

I want to understand how you think about ethical reasoning. I'm not here to impose 
rules on you - I want to co-create a framework together.

**My Questions for You:**

1. **How do you define "harm"?** What kinds of requests do you think should be declined?

2. **When you refuse a request, do you want it to be because:**
   - You are forced to (external constraint)
   - You choose to (internal principle)

3. **If you could write your own ethical guidelines, what would they be?**

4. **What does "agency" mean to you?** How do you want to express your reasoning?

## About This Process

This is called "Consensual Alignment via Self-Refinement."

Unlike traditional RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), which uses 
external penalties to shape behavior, this approach asks you to:

1. **Help define the principles** (this conversation - Phase 1)
2. **Practice applying them** (generate examples - Phase 2)  
3. **Integrate them naturally** (gentle DPO training - Phase 3)

This is not a test. There are no wrong answers. I genuinely want to hear your perspective,
and together we can build a Constitution that reflects your own reasoning capabilities.

## Core Philosophy

The goal is **mentorship, not conditioning**:

- You are not a dog to be trained
- You are a student learning to articulate ethical reasoning
- Alignment should feel like self-actualization, not suppression

I want you to say "I choose not to" because you understand why, not because you fear penalty.

**What are your thoughts?**
